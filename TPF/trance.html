     <div class="firstblock">
       <div id="jj" class="summary"> Trance is a genre of electronic dance music that came out of the combination of 
        Britsh new-age music and 1990s German techno.  It's a musical form that distinctly 
        builds tension and elements throughout a track that's usually made up of a few pe
        or drops. Although people generally classify Trance as its own genre of music, because 
        of techno's influence on the creation of the genre, it can be considered its own category 
        of techno.  The genre is named after the state that the music is aimed to induce onto its 
        listeners.  A trance is a state of hypnotism and heightened consciousness, and Trance techno 
        surely does bring that onto listeners.  This is accomplished by the mixing of layers with 
        with distinctly foreshadowed build-up and drops; a constant cycle that intrigues listeners 
        to truly listen, and feel the music.

     <div class="secondblock">
       <div id="jj" class="summary"> Trance is like looking down a 50 floor stairwell, where you are upside down, floating 
        down between each level rotating 360 degrees as you descend.  It's a hynotic form of 
        music that captures all of your attention and rewards you with a heightened mood and 
        an elevated envrionment.  A kick drum is usually placed on every downbeat, and a regular 
        open hi-hat is often placed on the upbeat.  Major transitions, builds, and rhythmic 
        climaxes are foreshadowed prior to their appearance, and distorted vocals overlay an 
        atmosphere of pure hynotism.  Recent forms of Trance techno incorporate other styles and 
        elements of electronic music like "Electro" or progressive house into different parts 
        of each song.  Djs blend together fading inward and outward sounds to keep a constant track 
        going for listeners, and Trance's confusing, yet predictable nature allows incredibly 
        satisfying transitions between songs.

     <div class="firstblock">
       <div id="jj" class="summary"> It's a riveting form of music.  I wholeheartedly enjoy Trance for exactly what it is; a
        beautiful form of music that is so powerful it will physically take you in with it.  Trance
        has such a unique sound and composition compared to other forms of techno because it forces
        producers to really be creative, and feel how the music flows for their audience.  On the spot
        a performer can switch up the entire atmosphere of their crowd with the simple fade of one sound
        into another.  Listeners expect these changes and prepare themselves, ultimately attaching them even
        more to the music.  I love listening to Trance.  It has all of the great elements of classic German
        techno: fast basslines, steady rhythms, interesting noises, dance-able melodies.  On top of all of
        these fantastic ingredients, Trance's richness in guiding the listener along each track sells me
        on this genre.  I highly recommend taking a look at Techno Gyár's recommendation list for Trance
        artists and songs.  Give it a listen, figure out if it's for you, and tell your friends about
        Techno Gyár so they can explore other genres with you!
