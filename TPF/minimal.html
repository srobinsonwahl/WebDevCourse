   <div class="firstblock">
     <div class="summary"> Minimal techno is a subgenre of techno characterized by a bare-bones style 
      with simplistic beats and rhythms.  This genre originated from Detroit in the 
      early 1990s, eventually popularized in Germany by well-known Djs and labels 
      big in the club scene.  Minimal came as a second wave of techno out of Detroit 
      after Detroit techno left the city and moved abroad into Germany and other eastern 
      European areas.  Picture your common electronic techno music.  Now take off 
      the rash, hard-sounds, and slow down the intensity of everything, and there 
      you will have Minimal techno.  It is a raw sound, with simple drums, bare 
      basslines, and only essential sounds to move you with the music.  Minimal 
      is all about the rhythm that you can produce with low amounts of distortion, 
      and a clean sound.

   <div class="secondblock">
     <div class="summary"> Minimal uses two specific stylistic appraoches: sleletalism and massification.
      In skeletal minimal techno, only the core elements of the sound are included 
      and the only variance in noises is kept at a bare minimum to keep interest in the 
      songs.  Massification is a style of minimalism in which many sounds are layered 
      over time, but with little variation in sonic elements.  Minimal techno's sound 
      is much more fit for the mainstream music industry where many songs are sampled 
      and chopped to become background to heavier pop songs.  The average tempo of a 
      minimal techno track is between 125 and 130 beats per minute, and focuses on 
      middle frequencies rather than deep basses to drive the listener towards euphoria.

   <div class="firstblock">
     <div class="summary">  Minimal is cool, it's hip, but it's not what I am looking for out of techno music. 
      I am a listener that loves depth to sounds, lots of distortion, and noises that can 
      peak my interest to listen harder.  Minimal's bare-bones approach doesn't offer me 
      those characteristics.  In my opinion, the only thing this subgenre offers me that I 
      enjoy is the clinical use of rhtyhm as the main driver for each song.  I appreciate 
      the science behind creating such catchy songs with little elements to them, but I can't 
      listen to a genre solely for that reason.  If you are against all of the experimental <
      samples and sounds that are found in other genres, and you want more of a mellow vibe, 
      minimal is definitely for you.  Give it a listen, figure out if it's for you, and tell 
      your friends about Techno Gy치r so they can explore other genres with you!
