     <div class="firstblock">
       <div class="summary"> Tech house is a subgenre of electronic music that mixes stylistic
        features of techno with house music.  In general, this style combines
        musical aspets of techno like edgy baselines and metallic beats with the
        grooves of house.  It is a lighter style of music with less harsh beats
        and more funky dance harmonies.  The music originally had a clean and
        minimal style that originated with techno from Detroit and the UK.  It's
        jazzy, captivating, and a vibe that could be seen as tranquil in the world
        of techno.  Since the early 2000's tech house has spread in Europe, with
        major influence in the dance scene of Spain.

     <div class="secondblock">
       <div class="summary"> As a mixture of multiple genres, tech house's sound has to be a proper 
        balance of deep techno baselines layered underneath a melodic house hook. 
        Elements of the house sound such as realistic jazz-sounds and booming kick 
        drums are replaced with techno's deep and distorted kicks, noiser snares, 
        and more synth melodies.  The sound is a middle ground between the two genres, 
        where techno's industrial tones are smoothed over with house's colorful 
        and peaceful tones.  Some songs offer soulful vocals on top of the funky 
        beats to create a more peaceful sound.  Tech house requires a mastery of balance.

       <div class="summary">  Tech house is more of my type.  I like the upbeat attitude that this subgenre 
        brings forward.  Outside of techno, I do enjoy listening to house music so I 
        think naturally this genre just makes sense to me.  Replacing house's jazz-sounds 
        with techno's brutal baselines and drums creates a sound that resonates well with 
        me.  It's a beautiful take on combining two subgenres that mix well together, and I am
        excited to see how much this genre will grow.  Eventually, tech house could 
        become popular enough for mainstream radio play as more and more people shift 
        away from hip-hop and into the electronic music scene.  Give it a listen, figure out 
        if it's for you, and tell you friends about Techno Gyár so they can explore other 
        genres with you!
