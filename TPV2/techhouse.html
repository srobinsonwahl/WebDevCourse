       <div class="summary"> Tech house is a subgenre of electronic music that mixes stylistic <br>
        features of techno with house music.  In general, this style combines <br>
        musical aspets of techno like edgy baselines and metallic beats with the <br>
        grooves of house.  It is a lighter style of music with less harsh beats <br>
        and more funky dance harmonies.  The music originally had a clean and <br>
        minimal style that originated with techno from Detroit and the UK.  It's <br>
        jazzy, captivating, and a vibe that could be seen as tranquil in the world <br>
        of techno.  Since the early 2000's tech house has spread in Europe, with <br>
        major influence in the dance scene of Spain.

     <div class="firstblock">
       <div class="summary"> As a mixture of multiple genres, tech house's sound has to be a proper <br>
        balance of deep techno baselines layered underneath a melodic house hook. <br>
        Elements of the house sound such as realistic jazz-sounds and booming kick <br>
        drums are replaced with techno's deep and distorted kicks, noiser snares, <br>
        and more synth melodies.  The sound is a middle ground between the two genres, <br>
        where techno's industrial tones are smoothed over with house's colorful <br>
        and peaceful tones.  Some songs offer soulful vocals on top of the funky <br>
        beats to create a more peaceful sound.  Tech house requires a mastery of balance.

       <div class="summary">  Tech house is more of my type.  I like the upbeat attitude that this subgenre <br>
        brings forward.  Outside of techno, I do enjoy listening to house music so I <br>
        think naturally this genre just makes sense to me.  Replacing house's jazz-sounds <br>
        with techno's brutal baselines and drums creates a sound that resonates well with <br>
        me.  It's a beautiful take on combining two subgenres that mix well together, and I am <br>
        excited to see how much this genre will grow.  Eventually, tech house could <br>
        become popular enough for mainstream radio play as more and more people shift <br>
        away from hip-hop and into the electronic music scene.  Give it a listen, figure out <br>
        if it's for you, and tell you friends about Techno Gy치r so they can explore other <br>
        genres with you!
