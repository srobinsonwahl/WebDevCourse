         <div class="summary"> Detroit techno is a subgenre of techno music that began from notable 
          productions by Detroit-based artists during the 1980s.  Detroit techno 
          pieces can be classified by their futuristic sound along with a funky and 
          classy tone that carries throughout songs.  This genre was made popular 
          in middle-class neighborhoods in Detroit where a new electronic scene 
          was creating a divide in the party atmosphere of the city.  One side 
          of the city was listening to hip-hop and rap while the other was diving 
          into European-influenced techno music.  This new age of music for the city 
          eventually led to the creation of Detroit's own sound; one of high-tech-sounding 
          beats accompanied by futuristic themes.

      </div>
   
       <div class="secondblock">
         <div class="summary"> The sound embodies a mixture of European techno instruments, Chicago-house
          influence, and an Afro-futuristic tone.  Synths and drum machines are
          heavily used in each song, creating an ultra-electro twang that carries
          the genre.  House-music's steady 4/4 beats were carried over into the Detroit
          sound, with danceable tempos that let people really enjoy their listening. 
          Sampling from science-fiction movies and other utopian noises are incorporated
          into each song, all the while maintaining a Black American style of music.
          Sonically, Detroit techno music combines the cool, detached dancefloor beats
          and textures of European electronic music with the soul and celebration of
          American funk music.

       <div class="firstblock">
         <div class="summary">   While the story of Detroit techno is respectable and interesting, I
          personally don't enjoy listening to this genre.  It's too futuristic
          for my liking and I find the spake-like sounds to be annoying to listen
          to.  After hearing a few hours of many techno subgenres, I wasn't too
          keen on Detroit's sound.  I enjoy listening to darker, hypnotic sounds
          that carry over deep baselines, and Detroit techno doesn't offer that. 
          It's unique, it's funky, and you must try out this subgenre if you want
          to feel like you're listening to the mainstream of 2080.
