     <div class="summary"> Minimal techno is a subgenre of techno characterized by a bare-bones style <br>
      with simplistic beats and rhythms.  This genre originated from Detroit in the <br>
      early 1990s, eventually popularized in Germany by well-known Djs and labels <br>
      big in the club scene.  Minimal came as a second wave of techno out of Detroit <br>
      after Detroit techno left the city and moved abroad into Germany and other eastern <br>
      European areas.  Picture your common electronic techno music.  Now take off <br>
      the rash, hard-sounds, and slow down the intensity of everything, and there <br>
      you will have Minimal techno.  It is a raw sound, with simple drums, bare <br>
      basslines, and only essential sounds to move you with the music.  Minimal <br>
      is all about the rhythm that you can produce with low amounts of distortion, <br>
      and a clean sound.

   <div class="firstblock">
     <div class="summary"> Minimal uses two specific stylistic appraoches: sleletalism and massification.<br>
      In skeletal minimal techno, only the core elements of the sound are included <br>
      and the only variance in noises is kept at a bare minimum to keep interest in the <br>
      songs.  Massification is a style of minimalism in which many sounds are layered <br>
      over time, but with little variation in sonic elements.  Minimal techno's sound <br>
      is much more fit for the mainstream music industry where many songs are sampled <br>
      and chopped to become background to heavier pop songs.  The average tempo of a <br>
      minimal techno track is between 125 and 130 beats per minute, and focuses on <br>
      middle frequencies rather than deep basses to drive the listener towards euphoria.

   <div class="firstblock">
     <div class="summary">  Minimal is cool, it's hip, but it's not what I am looking for out of techno music. <br>
      I am a listener that loves depth to sounds, lots of distortion, and noises that can <br>
      peak my interest to listen harder.  Minimal's bare-bones approach doesn't offer me <br>
      those characteristics.  In my opinion, the only thing this subgenre offers me that I <br>
      enjoy is the clinical use of rhtyhm as the main driver for each song.  I appreciate <br>
      the science behind creating such catchy songs with little elements to them, but I can't <br>
      listen to a genre solely for that reason.  If you are against all of the experimental <br> 
      samples and sounds that are found in other genres, and you want more of a mellow vibe, <br>
      minimal is definitely for you.  Give it a listen, figure out if it's for you, and tell <br>
      your friends about Techno Gyár so they can explore other genres with you!
