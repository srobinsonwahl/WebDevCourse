      <div class="summary"> Industrial techno is a dark, hard-hitting style of Techno 
        that incorporates rhythms and parallels with the sounds and 
        settings of factories with machinery.  The subgenre originated 
        in the 1990s, with key artists such as Cut Hands, Helena Hauff, 
        Surgeon, and many more growing the style to a higher popularity. 
        Industrial techno has a grittier, complex and layered sound 
        with an extremely experimental side to it.  Artists layer tracks 
        with obscure machinery noises and fast-paced, bleak baselines 
        to produce a foggy aura that takes you to the 19th century factory 
        floor.  Instead of putting cogs on a rail, you will be jumping, 
        waving, yelling, spinning, stepping, and bobbing: All.  Night.  Long.</td>

    <div class="secondblock">
      <div class="summary"> It's noisy, less melodic, a ton of distortoin, and generally 
        much faster than any electronic music you'll see when you're out. 
        One could even describe the sound as "pots and pans"; we certainly 
        think it's much deeper than that.  Techno Industrial incoporates 
        metallic, machine-like symphonies and other sounds that aren't 
        typically used in mainstream techno.  The subgenre coins the term 
        "industrial" because artists create tracks with the objective of 
        creating something that reflects the industrial world, an approach 
        that isn't seen in any other genres.  Lots of clanks, lots of abrupt 
        banging, and distorted sampling methods combine into an extremely 
        rash, mind-numbing sound; a sound we call Industrial Techno.

      <div class="summary"> I must preface, in no means am I an expert in any kinds of music
        While I enjoy listening and exploring all kinds of genres of music
        I do not work in this field, I do not know how to create these sounds,
        I am just a consumer; a college-student consumer who likes electronic
        music.  Industrial techno is not my favorite.  In my view, the clunky,
        abrasive sounds make it difficult for me to really tune in to the music.
        It's hard for me to follow a track from start to finish when every few
        seconds there is a sampled drill-sound being blasted into my ears. 
        Although I understand this sound has had a ton of glory in the past,
        it's not my taste.  I prefer more melodic, transe-like sounds that
        flow well across the track.  Industrial techno doesn't offer me that
        but it does offer something experimental.  Give it a listen, figure out
        if it's for you, and tell you friends about Techno Gyár so they can
        explore other genres with you!
