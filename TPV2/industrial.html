      <div class="summary"> Industrial techno is a dark, hard-hitting style of Techno <br>
        that incorporates rhythms and parallels with the sounds and <br>
        settings of factories with machinery.  The subgenre originated <br>
        in the 1990s, with key artists such as Cut Hands, Helena Hauff, <br>
        Surgeon, and many more growing the style to a higher popularity. <br>
        Industrial techno has a grittier, complex and layered sound <br>
        with an extremely experimental side to it.  Artists layer tracks <br>
        with obscure machinery noises and fast-paced, bleak baselines <br>
        to produce a foggy aura that takes you to the 19th century factory <br>
        floor.  Instead of putting cogs on a rail, you will be jumping, <br>
        waving, yelling, spinning, stepping, and bobbing: All.  Night.  Long.</td>

    <div class="firstblock">
      <div class="summary"> It's noisy, less melodic, a ton of distortoin, and generally <br>
        much faster than any electronic music you'll see when you're out. <br>
        One could even describe the sound as "pots and pans"; we certainly <br>
        think it's much deeper than that.  Techno Industrial incoporates <br>
        metallic, machine-like symphonies and other sounds that aren't <br>
        typically used in mainstream techno.  The subgenre coins the term <br>
        "industrial" because artists create tracks with the objective of <br>
        creating something that reflects the industrial world, an approach <br>
        that isn't seen in any other genres.  Lots of clanks, lots of abrupt <br>
        banging, and distorted sampling methods combine into an extremely <br>
        rash, mind-numbing sound; a sound we call Industrial Techno.

      <div class="summary"> I must preface, in no means am I an expert in any kinds of music <br>
        While I enjoy listening and exploring all kinds of genres of music <br>
        I do not work in this field, I do not know how to create these sounds, <br>
        I am just a consumer; a college-student consumer who likes electronic <br>
        music.  Industrial techno is not my favorite.  In my view, the clunky, <br>
        abrasive sounds make it difficult for me to really tune in to the music. <br>
        It's hard for me to follow a track from start to finish when every few <br>
        seconds there is a sampled drill-sound being blasted into my ears.  <br>
        Although I understand this sound has had a ton of glory in the past, <br>
        it's not my taste.  I prefer more melodic, transe-like sounds that <br>
        flow well across the track.  Industrial techno doesn't offer me that <br>
        but it does offer something experimental.  Give it a listen, figure out <br>
        if it's for you, and tell you friends about Techno Gy치r so they can <br>
        explore other genres with you!
