          Detroit techno is a subgenre of techno music that began from notable <br>
          productions by Detroit-based artists during the 1980s.  Detroit techno <br>
          pieces can be classified by their futuristic sound along with a funky and <br>
          classy tone that carries throughout songs.  This genre was made popular <br>
          in middle-class neighborhoods in Detroit where a new electronic scene <br>
          was creating a divide in the party atmosphere of the city.  One side <br>
          of the city was listening to hip-hop and rap while the other was diving <br>
          into European-influenced techno music.  This new age of music for the city <br>
          eventually led to the creation of Detroit's own sound; one of high-tech-sounding <br>
          beats accompanied by futuristic themes.

            The sound embodies a mixture of European techno instruments, Chicago-house <br>
            influence, and an Afro-futuristic tone.  Synths and drum machines are <br>
            heavily used in each song, creating an ultra-electro twang that carries <br>
            the genre.  House-music's steady 4/4 beats were carried over into the Detroit <br>
            sound, with danceable tempos that let people really enjoy their listening.  <br>
            Sampling from science-fiction movies and other utopian noises are incorporated <br>
            into each song, all the while maintaining a Black American style of music. <br>
            Sonically, Detroit techno music combines the cool, detached dancefloor beats <br>
            and textures of European electronic music with the soul and celebration of <br>
            American funk music.

            While the story of Detroit techno is respectable and interesting, I <br>
            personally don't enjoy listening to this genre.  It's too futuristic <br>
            for my liking and I find the spake-like sounds to be annoying to listen <br>
            to.  After hearing a few hours of many techno subgenres, I wasn't too <br>
            keen on Detroit's sound.  I enjoy listening to darker, hypnotic sounds <br>
            that carry over deep baselines, and Detroit techno doesn't offer that.  <br>
            It's unique, it's funky, and you must try out this subgenre if you want <br>
            to feel like you're listening to the mainstream of 2080.
