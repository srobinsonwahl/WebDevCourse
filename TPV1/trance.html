            Trance is a genre of electronic dance music that came out of the combination of <br>
            Britsh new-age music and 1990s German techno.  It's a musical form that distinctly <br>
            builds tension and elements throughout a track that's usually made up of a few peaks, <Br>
            or drops.  Although people generally classify Trance as its own genre of music, because <br>
            of techno's influence on the creation of the genre, it can be considered its own category <br>
            of techno.  The genre is named after the state that the music is aimed to induce onto its <br>
            listeners.  A trance is a state of hypnotism and heightened consciousness, and Trance techno <br>
            surely does bring that onto listeners.  This is accomplished by the mixing of layers with <br>
            with distinctly foreshadowed build-up and drops; a constant cycle that intrigues listeners <br>
            to truly listen, and feel the music.

            Trance is like looking down a 50 floor stairwell, where you are upside down, floating <br>
            down between each level rotating 360 degrees as you descend.  It's a hynotic form of <br>
            music that captures all of your attention and rewards you with a heightened mood and <br>
            an elevated envrionment.  A kick drum is usually placed on every downbeat, and a regular <br>
            open hi-hat is often placed on the upbeat.  Major transitions, builds, and rhythmic <br>
            climaxes are foreshadowed prior to their appearance, and distorted vocals overlay an <br>
            atmosphere of pure hynotism.  Recent forms of Trance techno incorporate other styles and <Br>
            elements of electronic music like "Electro" or progressive house into different parts <br>
            of each song.  Djs blend together fading inward and outward sounds to keep a constant track <br>
            going for listeners, and Trance's confusing, yet predictable nature allows incredibly <Br>
            satisfying transitions between songs.

            It's a riveting form of music.  I wholeheartedly enjoy Trance for exactly what it is; a <br>
            beautiful form of music that is so powerful it will physically take you in with it.  Trance <br>
            has such a unique sound and composition compared to other forms of techno because it forces <br>
            producers to really be creative, and feel how the music flows for their audience.  On the spot <br>
            a performer can switch up the entire atmosphere of their crowd with the simple fade of one sound <br>
            into another.  Listeners expect these changes and prepare themselves, ultimately attaching them even <Br>
            more to the music.  I love listening to Trance.  It has all of the great elements of classic German <br>
            techno: fast basslines, steady rhythms, interesting noises, dance-able melodies.  On top of all of <br>
            these fantastic ingredients, Trance's richness in guiding the listener along each track sells me <br>
            on this genre.  I highly recommend taking a look at Techno Gy치r's recommendation list for Trance <br>
            artists and songs.  Give it a listen, figure out if it's for you, and tell your friends about <br>
            Techno Gy치r so they can explore other genres with you!
