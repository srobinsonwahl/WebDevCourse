<center><h2>My Project Proposal</h2></center>
<p>
    <ol>
    <li><h4>What is the objective of your website?</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><h5>The plan for my semester project is to create an interactive website following
                my journey of discovering techno music.  I plan to review different subgenres of
                this category of music, and write informative and opinionated summaries of the sounds
                I will be listening to.  This website will provide viewers insight into the techno music
                scene, and offer links to other sites to explore more.  My website will be broken down into 
                five subgenre pages, with two of those pages including a list of my favorite songs from each.  
                I have always been into discovering new types of music, and lately I am fascinated by the 
                eastern European techno genre.  My website's style will be influenced by the aesthetics put
                forth throughout this music scene (industrialism, post-punk, etc.).
        </h5></li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><h4>Who is the target audience for your website?</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><h5>My website is to inform electronic music followers of a select handful of subgenres
                in order for them to listen more, and possibly find the perfect type of music for themselves. 
        </h5></li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><h4>What content do you plan to include in each page?</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><h5>Most pages that are directly related to the subgenres will include a summary of each type of music, 
                in depth explanations of the sounds found in each genre, and offer a personal take as well.  Each page
                will be similar in styling, and offer accurate visuals that go along with the page's contents.  Links
                to other sites or examples of music will also be included. </h5> 
            </li>
        </ul>
        </li>
