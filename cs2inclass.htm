<h2 id="me">About Me</h2>
<p>Hello.  I am a Sophomore from Mashpee, MA that's pursuing an IT concentration 
	for my years at <a href="http://www.babson.edu">Babson College</a>.  My name is Stephen and anyone can call me St(ee)phen, Steve, etc. 
	I have always been interested in technology and it's recent advancements and I would like 
	to learn as much as I can about tech's function in business.  I am from Mashpee, 
	Massachusetts, a small coastal town on Cape Cod that's been rapidly developing  over the 
	past few years.  I am a focused student that's always been biased towards the sciences 
	because I like to learn about how certain processes in life work.  After I graduate Babson, 
	I want to work remotely for a tech-startup managing IT while living abroad in Europe.  I 
	I will be able to see the world while I work; staying out of the 9-5 standard cubicle work 
	life. </p>

<h2 id="hob">My Interests</h2>
<p>During my free-time I like to keep my brain working creatively by discovering
	new music genres, researching background to the music I listen to, and my friends and I 
	sometimes play music ourselves.  Music has always been one of my interests and I find myself
	listening for hours on end some days.  I am also dedicated to health and wellness, and I 
	like to lift weights to stay in shape and keep my mind clear.  There is something about
	getting into a workout that makes everything I've been stressing about disappear, so I try 
	to get to the gym at least 4 times a week.  I am a cook at an Italian restaurant when I'm 
	not in school, so making delicious meals is another one of my hobbies.  I've been cooking
	for almost 3 years, and right now, my favorite meal to make is a New York Strip steak with 
	risotto and asparagus.</p>
